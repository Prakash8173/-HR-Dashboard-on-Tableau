# Tableau-Dashboard
This project demonstrates an HR Analyst Dashboard built using Tableau, with data sourced from MS Excel. The dashboard is designed to provide key insights into various HR metrics, helping organizations analyze workforce trends and make informed decisions.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Department-wise Attrition: Tracks employee attrition across different departments to identify areas with high turnover rates.

Attrition by Gender: Analyzes attrition trends by gender, helping to assess gender diversity and workforce stability.

Number of Employees by Age Group: Displays the distribution of employees across different age groups, offering insights into workforce demographics.

Education Field Breakdown: Provides a breakdown of employees by their educational fields, helping to understand the diversity of educational backgrounds within the organization.

Attrition Rate by Gender and Age Group: Monitors attrition rates by gender and age group, identifying trends and potential areas of concern.

### Interactive Filters:
The dashboard includes dynamic filters, allowing users to drill down into specific data segments for more targeted analysis. Filters include:

Department: View attrition and other metrics based on specific departments.

Gender: Filter the dashboard to analyze data by gender.

Age Groups: Focus on particular age groups to assess trends within different age demographics.

Education Field: Filter data by the education field of employees to gain insights into how attrition relates to educational background.

### Purpose:
The HR Analyst Dashboard is built to be user-friendly and visually intuitive, providing HR professionals and decision-makers with the tools they need to analyze key workforce metrics. By offering detailed insights into employee attrition, demographics, and educational backgrounds, the dashboard enables organizations to make data-driven HR decisions and develop strategies to improve employee retention and diversity.
